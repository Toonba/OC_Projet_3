# OC_Projet_3 : Make a webpage dynamic with CSS animations

For this project we work for _ohmyfood_ a young startup that would like to impose itself on the restaurant market.
Our mission is to develop a "mobile first" website that lists the menus of gourmet restaurants and adding some annimation (loading pages, hover animation and animation once loaded)

For this project we have learned to use sass
